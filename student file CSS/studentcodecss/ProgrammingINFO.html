    <li><h3><p><i>1st of all you need to know "What is programming language?"</i></p></h3></li>
        <pre><i>
        Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions
        that tell a computer how to perform a task.
        Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming languages,
        such as JavaScript, Python, and C++.
        </pre></li>
    <li><h3><p><i>What are Computer Programming languages?</i></p></h3></li>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions
            to a computer in a language the computer understands.
            Just as many human-based languages exist, there are an array
            of computer programming languages that programmers can use
            to communicate with a computer. The portion of the language
            that a computer can understand is called a “binary.”
            Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.”
            Each language, from C Language to Python, has its own distinct features,
            though many times there are commonalities between programming languages.
        </pre></li></ul>
        <ul><li><pre>
            These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process
            large and complex swaths of information. For example,
            if a person is given a list of randomized numbers ranging
            from one to ten thousand and is asked to place them in ascending order,
            chances are that it will take a sizable amount of time and include some errors.
        </pre></li></ul>
        <ul><li><pre>
            There are dozens of programming languages used in the industry today.
            We've compiled overviews of the 12 most important,
            relevant and in-demand of these languages below.

    <li><h3><p><i>What is Coding?</i></p></h3></li>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Electronic devices like cell phones, laptops,
            and tablets require code to function properly.
            Coding allows humans to communicate with these devices.
            Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators,
            smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems.
        </pre></li></ul>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Since computers do not communicate like humans, 
            coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input
            into numerical sequences that computers understand.
            Once computers receive these messages,
            they complete assigned tasks such as
            changing font colors or centering an image.

    <li><h3><p><i>What is Coding Used For?</i></p></h3></li>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Developers use a variety of programming languages
            to build websites and applications.
            Front-end developers typically use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code
            to create website layouts and design functions.
        </pre></li></ul>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Websites with user accounts, 
            like Facebook, Instagram, or LinkedIn,
            require back-end developers to write computer code
            that connects websites to databases.
            Back-end developers often write code
            using languages such as SQL, Java, and Python.
        </pre></li></ul>
        <ul><li><pre>
            Developers use other languages like Python,
            Objective-C, C#, Swift, or Ruby on Rails
            to create apps for cell phones and computer software.
